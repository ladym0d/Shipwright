## Sunday, Aug 24, 2025

- ✅ Confirmed OBS records mic input (new external mic) with clear audio.
- ✅ Confirmed OBS records system audio from Surface.
- ✅ Room capture test: AI copilot voice audible in recording.
- ✅ Proved end-to-end workflow: Start Recording → Blender work → Stop Recording → playback shows both voices.
- Next up: overlay setup + cleaner audio feed (USB adapter).
## Friday, Aug 29, 2025

- ✅ Fixed overlay CSS link bug (styler.css → styles.css).
- ✅ Verified that OBS loads index.html + styles.css + main.js correctly.
- ✅ Buttons and captions are now large and readable inside OBS.
- ✅ Confirmed arrows and captions display at the right scale in test recordings.
- 📌 Milestone: Browser overlay is functional and ready for live Blender recordings.
- 🔜 Next step: integrate overlay into an actual Blender workflow test (arrows + captions during modeling).
-   Personal milestone: edited daily_task_list.md manually instead of copy-paste)

## Monday, September 1, 2025

- Set up OBS → VirtualCam → Discord “Bridge” workflow.  
- Verified that the Blender + overlay feed can be streamed into Discord voice/video channels.  
- Successfully tested using a second account (Reya McVay) to view the feed from the Bridge channel.  
- Confirmed that the setup works for human collaborators, but noted that ChatGPT cannot directly access Discord’s video feed.  
- Decided to build a separate Shipwright shim (using OBS WebSocket + local dashboard) as the long-term solution for AI copilot integration.
## Tuesday, September 2, 2025

- Installed Node.js and npm on the Surface Pro.  
- Added required npm packages (`obs-websocket-js`, `express`, `dotenv`) to the Shipwright shim.  
- Built the first version of the shim (`app.cjs`) for connecting OBS to a local dashboard and overlay relay.  
- Configured `.env` with OBS WebSocket settings (host, port, password).  
- Fixed authentication issue by correcting the saved password.  
- Successfully connected the shim to OBS WebSocket 🎉.  
- Dashboard now running at `http://localhost:8788` and overlay relay at `ws://localhost:8787`.  
## Wednesday, September 3, 2025

- Debugged and cleaned up the Shipwright shim (`app.cjs`).
- Fixed duplicate/typo issues and replaced undefined variables with the correct source name.
- Verified `/screenshot` endpoint successfully returns live OBS frames from the `blender` source.
- Confirmed the dashboard refreshes with updated screenshots.
- Reached first full end-to-end test: OBS → shim → dashboard → overlay → OBS loop works as intended.
